It is written in php and it is useful for ripetitive tasks or to 
manage of complex structures. The examples provided here are 
very simple and they are not so much useful. But think to manage 
more than 200 user GNU argplib input or to share a lots of variables 
with other software developers.

glxCodeGen helps you to change your source code automatically.  
 
With glxCodeGen you need just three steps:
1. choose a delimiter for your source files;
2. define one array with your datas; 
3. extends the glxCodeGen class to inject your code.

You can find three examples:
launcher1.php - minimal example
launcher2.php - a more complex example
launcher_argp.php - a real example usage 

You can launch all examples typing 
# ``./demo.sh``
